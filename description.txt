!! Mod can be used without Calamity !!

I want to re-made the "Pet Hypnos in Hypnos Mod", because the character appearance has changed, and I don't like the old sprites.

Added a chibii Hypnos as a town NPC. (Soul of the Eternal Intellect of Infinite Verboten Knowledge)

After defeating any mechanical bosses, the chibii Hypnos randomly appears, stays and departs in your town, like a traveling merchant.
It does not offer shop, instead, it has a "Pray" option available.

1 gold is required to prove your faith to Hypnos. There will be random rewards according to your faithful acts, such as golden delights, exo prisms(post-Exo Mechs only), or even instantly send you to the eternal kingdom of heaven!

You will get "Indulgence" after praying, used for special crafting.

Added chibii Aergia Neurons as vanity pet and light pet, crafted from Indulgence and wires.

Added a portable radio transmitter to request Hypnos' visit to your town, crafted from Indulgence and wires. It needs Indulgence to work.
It can be upgraded in Ancient Manipulator, keeping Hypnos in your town (can be toggled).

Notes:

Chibii Hypnos can be killed if Hypnos(Boss) is present and killed, dropping all golds collected.

!! 本mod可以在没有灾厄的情况使用 !!

加入了修普诺斯娘作为城镇NPC。

打败任意机械boss后，修普诺斯会在玩家的城镇随机出现、停留和离开，类似旅行商人。
它不卖东西，替代地，它有一个 “祈祷” 选项。

为了证明你对它的忠诚，一枚金币是必要的付出。根据你的信仰之举，它会奖励你各种东西，金美味，星流棱镜（巨械后），甚至直接送你飞升上它的永恒之国度！

备注：

在修普诺斯(boss)被击败的时候，修普诺斯娘会死掉，爆出所有收集的金币。
